              The 1st International Conference on Smart and Sustainable
              Technologies in Energy and Power Sectors (SSTEPS-2022) is being
              organized by the Department of Electrical Engineering, School of
              Engineering and Technology, Central University of Haryana on
              7th-9th Nov, 2022 at Mahendragarh, Haryana, India. SSTEPS-2022
              will provide an international platform for academicians,
              researchers, industrial experts and technocrafts to discuss and
              share progressive achievements, technical developments and
              limitations in the field of energy and power sector.
              <br /> <br /> All the accepted papers are available in IEEE Xplore
              Digital Library. Distinguished people will be invited to deliver
